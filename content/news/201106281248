ASCIIpOrtal website coming soon
===================

As you might have noticed, the new website for ASCIIpOrtal is almost ready, we only need a bit of CSS work and add some content. We should move it to <http://asciiportal.cymonsgames.com> pretty soon.

I wrote it from scratch using the [Smarty][] template engine (PHP), [Markdown][] and a bit of [Yaml][]. A big thank to **cynddl** for its CSS knowledge, and of course to **Joe** for making ASCIIpOrtal in the first place ;)
