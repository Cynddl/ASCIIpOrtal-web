About this website
------------------

This is the developement version of the ASCIIpOrtal website, so don't expect it to be fully functional, not to mention the ugly design. The architecture was designed from the ground up by zorun.

At the moment, the basic architecture is working using *Smarty* (template engine) and *Markdown* for content, and we have a *nice* FAQ system (by *nice*, I mean it is technically pleasing) that makes use of both Yaml and Markdown.

The code of this website is available on Github: [ASCIIpOrtal-web](https://github.com/zorun/ASCIIpOrtal-web). Feel free to contribute (especially from a design point of view, CSS doesn't like me :) )
