- q: "Dummy question (which does not even have a question mark)"

   This is a good question. I'll try to answer, but first:

     * this is a markdown answer
     * so you can easily place a <http://link.com> like this
  
- q: "Do you ...?"
  a: |
    I don't like this question... sorry!

- q: "Why does ASCIIpOrtal suck so much?"
  a: |
   Do you mean it?
   Well, it looks like you haven't played **ASCIIpOrtal** yet, or you would have found yourself bewildered by its power.

- q: "How does your FAQ system work? It looks wonderful!"
  a: |
   We're using a Yaml file to describe questions/answers, and let Smarty do the work of displaying a nice table of content (well, it will be nice with some CSS :) ).

   The cool thing is that answers are written in [Markdown][md] inside the yaml faq file, so it allows complicated presentations in a simple way.

   You can see the original yaml file [here][github-faq] on Github.
